Add midi support to acoustic accordion

Introduction
Accordions are usually acoustic music instruments that utilizes air pressure on metal reeds in order to produce various sounds. Some companies produce digital accordions or add electronics to an acoustic accordion in order to produce digital sounds similarly to digital keyboards. A common way to do this is to use physical sensors connected to a digital converter to convert signals from the sensors to MIDI messages that are in turn fed into a sound module to produce sounds. 
The goal of this project is to make an acoustic accordion to produce digital sounds. To achieve this I used:
1. Sensors: 40 hall effects and 40 tiny magnets
2. Arduino uno + Usb cable
3. 3 of 16 channel analog multiplexers  
4. Electronic Board (hold and connect the sensors).
5. PC (operated as a sound module)
